## Fake News Detection Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

# Project Description:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect fake news using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. In todayâ€™s digital era, the rapid spread of misinformation and fake news through online platforms has become a significant concern. To combat this issue, the project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and analyze textual data from news articles and social media posts.

The system is trained on a labeled dataset consisting of both fake and real news articles. Key NLP techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, and vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF) are applied to convert raw text into numerical features suitable for classification.

SVM is chosen due to its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and its ability to find the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes. The model is trained and validated to distinguish between fake and real news with a focus on achieving high accuracy and generalizability.
